# Algorithms 
This is a repository where I add different Algorithms I have solved 

- Numbers Vision
    This is an algorithm I had during a test I had,
    given a number (341525), each digit (n) can 'see' n of numbers to it's left and right
    i.e: the digit 4 (index=1) can see digit "3" to its left and digits "1", "5", "2", "5"

    requirement: find the sum of each of the numbers visible digits, return the digit with the least sum which can see a the number 1
